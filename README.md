# AR Project
This project was for an Augmented Reality course.
It was inspired by work of [@RoelOfKnoel](https://www.instagram.com/roelofknol/).
Using a projector and Kinect camera, markers on a wall were tracked and triangles were drawn between these points on the wall using Delauney triangulation.
Additionally, using the Processing fast Fourier transform tool, a soundfile could be loaded and the triangles that were projected on the wall would vary in brightness depending on the music. 
A demo can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUKo43Kkt5nbIhK7HUrJk12ZpITDCW-N/view) (Warning: Flashing/Flickering lights present)
